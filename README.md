#VisDA2018 Challenge

Hi!

This is the development kit repository for the [2018 Visual Domain Adaptation (VisDA) Challenge](http://ai.bu.edu/visda-2018/). Here you can find details on how to download datasets, run baseline models and evaluate the perfomance of your model. The evaluation can be performed both locally and remotely on the CodaLab evaluation server (coming soon). Please see the main website for competition details, rules and dates.

You can find the development kits (beta release) for the two competition tracks by following these links:
- [openset classification track](classification)
- [detection track](detection) 


If you consider using data, code or its derivatives, please consider citing:



If you find any bugs please [open an issue](https://github.com/MInner/taskcv-2018-public/issues).

Have fun!
